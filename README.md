Have you ever felt that Minecraft's world was tooâ€¦ desolate? Uninviting? Or
perhaps, is it just not exciting? Worry no longer! MyWorldGen revolutionizes
Minecraft world generation. Rather than introducing new biomes, or trying to
make up strange-looking hard-coded structures, MyWorldGen relies on *you* to
populate your world. All you have to do is put some schematic files into your
.minecraft/worldgen folder, and they'll start showing up in your single-player
worlds. You can also install it onto a server, and have custom worldgen for
your own community!
